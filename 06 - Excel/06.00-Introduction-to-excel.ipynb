It will provide you with an overview of packages that you can use to load and write these spreadsheets to files with the help of Python.

This data might be in an Excel file or saved to a file with .csv extension, … The possibilities can seem endless sometimes. But whenever you have data, your first step should be to make sure that you’re working with a qualitative data.\n",

    "- Does your spreadsheet mix data, calculation, and reporting?\n",

Of course, the above list is not exhaustive: there are many more general rules that you can follow to make sure your spreadsheet is not an ugly duckling. However, the questions that have been formulated above are most relevant for when you want to make sure if the spreadsheet is qualitative."

    "Previous to reading in your spreadsheet in Python, you also want to consider adjusting your file to meet some basic principles, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first row of the spreadsheet is usually reserved for the header, while the first column is used to identify the sampling unit;\n",
    "- Avoid names, values or fields with blank spaces. Otherwise, each word will be interpreted as a separate variable, resulting in errors that are related to the number of elements per line in your data set. Consider using:\n",
    " - Underscores,\n",
    " - Dashes,\n",
    " - Camel case, where the first letter of each section of text is capitalized, or\n",
    " - Concatenating words\n",
    "- Short names are preferred over longer names;\n",
    "- Try to avoid using names that contain symbols such as ?, `$`,`%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `(`,`)`,`-`,`#`, `?`,`,`,`<`,`>`, `/`, `|`, `\\`, `[` ,`]` ,`{`, and `}`;\n",
    "- Delete any comments that you have made in your file to avoid extra columns or NA’s to be added to your file; and\n",
    "Make sure that any missing values in your data set are indicated with NA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, after you have made the necessary changes or when you have taken a thorough look at your data, make sure that you save your changes if you have made any. By doing this, you can revisit the data later to edit it, to add more data or to change them, while you preserve the formulas that you maybe used to calculate the data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re working with Microsoft Excel, you’ll see that there are a considerable amount of options to save your file: besides the default extension `.xls` or .`xlsx`, you can go to the “File” tab, click on “Save As” and select one of the extensions that are listed as the “Save as Type” options. The most commonly used extensions to save datasets for data science are `.csv` and `.txt` (as tab-delimited text file). Depending on the saving option that you choose, your data set’s fields are separated by tabs or commas, which will make up the “field separator characters” of your data set.\n",
